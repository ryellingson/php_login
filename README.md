# Sign up and log in with PHP, Apache, and MySQL

### Check out the [LIVE DEMO](https://php-signup-login.herokuapp.com/), hosted on Heroku

(Click on any of the images below to enlarge them.)

The desired behavior is fairly simple. A user signs up, their details are saved to the database, and then the user is able log in with the details.

Configuring the environment was a bit more complicated.

## Development was done locally in XAMPP

The database was configured in phpMyAdmin.

## Deployment was done in Heroku

I moved the bulk of the project into a web folder per the guidelines Heroku gives for the Procfile when using PHP. I intially left the composer.json file empty which was throwing a bunch of warnings, an empty object in the file solved this. The composer.json file is important because it's what Heroku uses to assign the PHP buildpack to the app.

I opted to use [ClearDB MySQL](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cleardb) for my Heroku database. Their free tier plan (Ignite) was perfect for this use case.

I was having trouble connecting to my ClearDB database with phpMyAdmin. I couldn't seem to get changes to save in the config.inc.php in the phpmyadmin folder in the XAMPP volumes. The problem could be permissions based, or maybe something to do with my computer being a Mac. Anyhow, something to look into in the future.

I ended up using [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to connect to and configure my Heroku database. It worked like a charm.

The SQL was easy because I just exported the statements generated by phpMyAdmin, put them into Workbench, and voil√†:

Time for a final test.

Yay! The User can log in with their details and upon refresh, we see them in the database :)

All and all a very fun project. Deploying it to Heroku added all whole new level of challenge.
